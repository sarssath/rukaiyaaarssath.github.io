  <div class="column1"> My name is Rukaiyaa Arssath and I am currently a Junior at the High School of Fashion Industries and a business major. I am a first-generation American born and raised in Queens, NY. I'm interested in pursuing a career in law as I am all for building communities with individuals and being able to resonate with people's stories. In my free time, I love to do anything and everything that allows me to be innovative and express my creativity in areas like art and design, while also being able to learn something new always.</div>
